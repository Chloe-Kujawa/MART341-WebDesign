* Working on a previous assignment 
**Assignment 7 - index.html**

* Atleast 6 techniques - 
    * **Sizing** – Adjusted the size of the boxes to create a little juxtaposition from that bigger box.
    * **Overflow** – Used the scroll overflow to designate images into one boxed area, keeping it orderly.
    * **Border** – Used a quick border to emphasize the text that was really small.
    * **Margin** – Used it to adjust its position from the right side. It helped keep it on the page even when minimized.
    * **Padding** – I put padding in the box area so the text isn't close to the borders and it creates better harmony.
    * **Display** - Putting a block in there to display important text and it creates emphasis, also made a divider thing with the larger box.
    * **Dropdown** – Thought that it would be cool to add a dropdown menu, but I didn't want to do it for the contact page. Maybe another time.
    * **Position** – Stuck the positioning onto the body text which effects the contact and index, it didn't really effect much with/without it. It'll be nice to use it if I need to change it later.
