# <h1> Assignment - 3
## <h2> How's the course going for you so far? The semester?

It's going fine, When I make time to look at the material I find that the *information is interesting*, but the information starts to *blur together* after a while so I try to take frequent breaks. I also found it hard to remember when to do my work when it's *not in my Canvas Dashboard*. I was also *behind on my quizzes* which I'm sorry about, I finally caught up though!

### The semester in general...
1. **Glum**
2. **Cold**
3. **I don't want to go outside**

   - I want **SPRING**!
