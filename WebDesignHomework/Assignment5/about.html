<h1> Why I Chose These </h1>

<h2> Portfolio Website - </h2>
<p> I was hoping to make a simple portfolio page to showcase <b>what I've made during my college classes.</b> It's a lot of random projects, I'm not sure about the tone, but leaning towards a professional tone. </p>
<h2> Review Website - </h2>
<p> I like making snack reviews, I want to remember which snacks I like or dislike so I can either avoid or buy it again. I would want to make it more cute and decorative, like a journal. </p>
<h2> Random Website - </h2>
<p> The idea of making a website for a almost useless reason sounds really interesting to me, it would definitely be something playful since it'd be entirely random.</p>
