* It went well, I think it made it easier to remember when to work on the assignments, although I might turn them in late. They'll get done!
* I'll be working on my **gallery.html**
1. CSS Style Sheet - gallery.html
2.  1 Class Selector - Used it in my body text to highlight the message.
3. 1 ID Selector - With my body text, used it to make another text box.

* 3 Additional Techniques
1. Positioned the bottom text to make it near the bottom and to have something to read while looking at page.
2. Used different background colors for each block of text in Gallery to create diversity
3. Different font colors and fonts for the text boxes.
